            <p>"A car is a vehicle that has wheels, carries a small number of passengers, and is moved by an engine or a
                motor. Cars are also called automobiles or motor vehicles. Trucks and buses are motor vehicles as well.
                However, trucks and buses are larger than cars, and they carry heavier loadsAutomobile safety is a
                continuing issue. Early cars were very dangerous to ride in. Since then car manufacturers have worked to
                create safer cars. They installed such devices as seat belts and air bags to protect riders in a crash.
                They have also tried to improve the way cars are built and the materials used to build cars so that the
                cars will survive a crash better."</p>
